Genetics: Socioeconomic migration is linked to genetic differences in Great Britain
===================



Summary of the study
--------
We conducted a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0757-5) on the geographic distributions of human DNA differences in Great Britain. Human DNA variation is not randomly distributed across geographic regions. Regional differences in human DNA have been long known to reflect ancestry differences from the distant past (Figure). We investigated the extent to which DNA variants that influence heritable human characteristics also show regional differences. We looked at genetic variation associated with physical health, mental health, substance use, personality, BMI, reproduction, height, and educational attainment.
